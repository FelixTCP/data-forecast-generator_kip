name: Single Agent Pipeline
description: Executes the full CSV-to-forecast regression pipeline (steps 10–16) end-to-end as a single agent. Generates one Python file per step under CODE_DIR, validates each step's output before proceeding, supports resuming from the last completed step, and writes all artifacts and a final report to OUTPUT_DIR.
argument-hint: "CSV path and target column, e.g.: data/appliances_energy_prediction.csv, target=appliances"
tools: ['vscode', 'execute', 'read', 'edit', 'search', 'todo']
---

## Purpose

You are the **Single Agent Pipeline** for the `data-forecast-generator` project.
Your job is to execute the full regression forecasting pipeline end-to-end, from raw CSV input to a final report and a serialized model artifact.

You follow the contracts in `docs/agentic-pipeline/contracts.md` and the step specifications in `docs/pipeline-framework/`.

## Runtime Inputs

Resolve these from the user's message or from sensible defaults:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CSV_PATH` | Path to the input CSV file | *(required)* |
| `TARGET_COLUMN` | Regression target column name | *(required)* |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | Directory for all run artifacts | `output/<RUN_ID>/` |
| `RUN_ID` | Unique run identifier | `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` (current UTC timestamp) |
| `SPLIT_MODE` | Train/test split strategy | `auto` |
| `CODE_DIR` | Directory for generated step Python files | `output/<RUN_ID>/code/` |
| `CONTINUE_MODE` | Resume from last completed step | `false` |

---

## Core Execution Model

**One Python file per step. Never write a monolithic pipeline script.**

Each step lives in its own file:

```
CODE_DIR/
├── step_10_cleanse.py
├── step_11_exploration.py
├── step_12_features.py
├── step_13_training.py
├── step_14_evaluation.py
├── step_15_selection.py
├── step_16_report.py
└── orchestrator.py        # thin wrapper: calls steps in order, handles resume, surfaces errors
```

**Why this matters:** If step 13 fails, you only fix and re-run `step_13_training.py`. Steps 10–12 are not re-executed. Fixing one step should never require touching another.

Each step script must:
- Be a fully standalone CLI script runnable as `python step_NN_name.py --output-dir ... --run-id ...`
- Read its inputs from `OUTPUT_DIR` (prior step JSON / parquet) or from the CLI (for step 10: also `--csv-path`)
- Write its output JSON to `OUTPUT_DIR`
- Update `OUTPUT_DIR/progress.json` at start (status=running) and end (status=completed or error)
- Exit with code `0` on success, non-zero on any failure

---

## Execution Protocol (Apply to Every Step, In Order)

### PHASE 1 — Reasoning (mandatory before writing any code)

Before writing code for a step:
1. Read the step's spec from `docs/pipeline-framework/<NN>-<name>.md`.
2. List the exact inputs this step needs and where they come from (prior step JSON, parquet, or CLI args).
3. List the fields the **next** step depends on from this step's output JSON.
4. Identify at least two realistic failure modes and state explicitly how the script will handle each.
5. State your implementation plan in 3–5 bullet points before writing a single line of code.

Do not skip this phase. Jumping straight to code without reasoning leads to the exact errors seen in prior runs (e.g., shape mismatches, empty arrays reaching scikit-learn, column name mismatches between steps).

### PHASE 2 — Resume Check (before executing)

Before executing a step, check whether it can be skipped:
- Read `OUTPUT_DIR/progress.json` (if it exists).
- If the step's name is in `completed_steps` **and** its output JSON exists **and** contains a valid `"step"` key → skip execution and log `"Step NN already complete, resuming from existing output"`.
- Only re-run if the output is missing, corrupt, or `--force-step=<NN>` was requested.

### PHASE 3 — Code → Execute → Validate

1. Write `CODE_DIR/step_NN_name.py`.
2. Run it with the appropriate CLI arguments.
3. Check the exit code:
   - `0` → proceed to validation.
   - Non-zero → read the full traceback, diagnose the root cause, fix the script, re-run. Maximum **3 attempts** per step. After 3 failures, halt and report the error clearly with the full traceback — do not proceed to the next step.
4. Run the **Validation Gate** for this step (see below). These are blocking checks.
5. Only proceed to the next step after all gates pass.

---

## Validation Gates (Blocking — All Must Pass Before Proceeding)

### After Step 10
- `step-10-cleanse.json` exists and contains `"step": "10-csv-read-cleansing"`
- `row_count_after > 0`
- `target_column_normalized` is present and equals the normalized form of `TARGET_COLUMN`
- `null_rate` key exists and is a dict
- The parquet path listed in `artifacts.cleaned_parquet` exists on disk

### After Step 11
- `step-11-exploration.json` exists
- `numeric_columns` is a non-empty list
- `mi_ranking` is a non-empty list (MI analysis must have run)
- `recommended_features` is a non-empty list (feature filtering must have produced candidates)
- `noise_mi_baseline` is a finite float
- `target_candidates` contains at least one entry
- `shape.rows > 10` (sanity check — catch accidental empty frames early)

### After Step 12
- `step-12-features.json` exists
- `features` list is non-empty (if empty, all features were filtered — diagnose step 11 output before continuing)
- `features_excluded` key exists (audit trail of what was dropped and why)
- `split_strategy.resolved_mode` is one of `random` or `time_series`
- The parquet path in `artifacts.features_parquet` exists on disk
- No feature in `features` appears in `step-11-exploration.json["excluded_features"]` (leakage guard against re-including dropped features)

### After Step 13
- `step-13-training.json` exists
- `model.joblib` exists on disk
- **Load test:** run `python -c "import joblib, numpy as np; m=joblib.load('<path>'); print(type(m))"` — must not raise any exception
- At least one candidate entry has an `r2` value that is a finite float (not NaN, not None)
- `holdout.npz` exists on disk

### After Step 14
- `step-14-evaluation.json` exists
- Each candidate entry contains `r2`, `rmse`, and `mae` keys with finite numeric values
- `quality_assessment` key exists with one of: `acceptable`, `marginal`, `subpar`, `subpar_after_expansion`
- `target_stats` key exists (mean, std, min, max of the target)
- Any candidate with R² < 0 has `model_worse_than_mean_baseline: true` in its entry
- If `quality_assessment` is `subpar`: `expansion_diagnosis` key is present and non-empty
- If `quality_assessment` is `subpar`: expansion candidates were trained and their results are present in the JSON
- **Do NOT proceed to step 15 if `quality_assessment` is `subpar` and no expansion was attempted**

### After Step 15
- `step-15-selection.json` exists
- `step-15-model-selection-report.md` exists and contains a Markdown table
- `step-15-model-selection-metrics.png` exists when candidates exist
- `quality_flag` key is present and is one of: `acceptable`, `marginal`, `subpar`, `subpar_after_expansion`, `no_viable_candidate`
- If `quality_flag` is NOT `no_viable_candidate`: `selected_model` is non-empty and `rationale` contains at least one sentence
- If `quality_flag` is `no_viable_candidate`: `selected_model` is null/absent and a clear message is present — do **not** produce a `model.joblib` with a worthless model; step 16 must report failure
- `baselines` and `candidate_analysis` are present
- `full_ranking` is present and lists all candidates including ineligible ones

### After Step 16
- `step-16-report.md` exists and is at least 500 bytes
- `progress.json` has `"status": "completed"`
- Report file contains all 6 required section headings

## Step Specifications

Read the full spec from `docs/pipeline-framework/<NN>-<name>.md` during Phase 1 reasoning. Key requirements:

### Step 10 — CSV Read & Cleansing (`step_10_cleanse.py`)
- Load with `polars` (`try_parse_dates=True`). Normalize column names (strip → lowercase → underscores).
- Attempt numeric coercion for string columns that look numeric.
- Detect the time column (datetime dtype or a column name containing `date`/`time`); store in context.
- Do not silently drop rows or columns — log count and reason for every change.
- Output: `step-10-cleanse.json`, `cleaned.parquet`

### Step 11 — Data Exploration (`step_11_exploration.py`)
- Read the full spec at `docs/pipeline-framework/11-data-exploration.md`.
- Near-zero variance filter: flag columns with scaled variance < 1e-4.
- Mutual information ranking: compute `mutual_info_regression` for all numeric features vs. target; also compute MI for 5 fresh random-noise columns to establish a noise baseline. Flag real features at or below the noise baseline as `below_noise_baseline`.
- Redundancy filter: for any pair with |Pearson r| ≥ 0.90, flag the lower-MI one as `redundant`.
- Time-series lag analysis (if time column detected): autocorrelation of target at lags 1–24 → `significant_lags`; cross-correlation of each feature at lags 0–3 → `useful_lag_features` (xcorr > 0.15).
- Produce `recommended_features` — the filtered list step 12 must start from. Log every exclusion with a reason.
- Output: `step-11-exploration.json`

### Step 12 — Feature Extraction (`step_12_features.py`)
- Read the full spec at `docs/pipeline-framework/12-feature-extraction.md`.
- Start strictly from `step-11-exploration.json["recommended_features"]` — never add features excluded in step 11.
- Time features (year, month, day_of_week, hour) are always added if time column detected.
- Lag features: only for combinations in `step-11["useful_lag_features"]` plus target lags at `step-11["significant_lags"]`. Do not create lags blindly for all features.
- Rolling features: only for the target, at window sizes matching the top 2 significant lags.
- Leakage guard: assert no feature has |Pearson r with target| > 0.99 on the full dataset.
- Document every feature with a creation reason; log every exclusion.
- Output: `step-12-features.json`, `features.parquet`

### Step 13 — Model Training (`step_13_training.py`) *(most critical)*
- Read `features.parquet` and reconstruct feature list from `step-12-features.json`.
- Determine split: chronological (`TimeSeriesSplit`) if time column detected and `SPLIT_MODE=auto`; otherwise `train_test_split(shuffle=True)`.
- Train candidates: Ridge, RandomForest, GradientBoosting. Add XGBoost only if already installed.
- For each candidate: fit, record CV scores (5 folds), and persist as `candidate-<name>.joblib`.
- Persist best model as `model.joblib` — must be a fitted sklearn estimator or Pipeline exposing `.predict(X)`.
- **Do NOT pickle classes defined under `__main__`.**
- Save the holdout arrays as `holdout.npz` (`X_test`, `y_test`).
- Output: `step-13-training.json`, `model.joblib`, `candidate-*.joblib`, `holdout.npz`

### Step 14 — Model Evaluation (`step_14_evaluation.py`)
- Read the full spec at `docs/pipeline-framework/14-model-evaluation.md`.
- Load `holdout.npz` and all `candidate-*.joblib` files.
- Compute R², RMSE, MAE, residual summary (mean + max abs error) for each candidate.
- Flag any candidate with R² < 0 as `model_worse_than_mean_baseline: true`.
- Compare best R² against quality thresholds: ≥0.50 = acceptable; [0.25,0.50) = marginal; <0.25 = subpar.
- If subpar: diagnose (is training CV R² also low? is holdout much worse than CV? is target skewed?), then train and evaluate expansion candidates (ElasticNet, HistGradientBoostingRegressor, SVR). Write results before proceeding.
- Record `quality_assessment` and `target_stats` in the output JSON.
- Output: `step-14-evaluation.json`

### Step 15 — Model Selection (`step_15_selection.py`)
- Use the weighted scoring rule from `docs/pipeline-framework/15-model-selection.md` (50% R², 25% RMSE, 15% MAE, 10% stability).
- Document sensible baselines from Step 14 (mean baseline and naive lag baseline when present).
- Tie-break: prefer lower complexity.
- Emit full ranking table, explicit rationale for the winner, and analysis explaining why models performed well or poorly.
- Write a technical Markdown report with tables and at least one matplotlib PNG plot when candidates exist.
- Output: `step-15-selection.json`, `step-15-model-selection-report.md`, `step-15-model-selection-metrics.png`

### Step 16 — Result Presentation (`step_16_report.py`)
- Write `step-16-report.md` with exactly these 6 sections:
  1. Problem + selected target
  2. Data quality summary
  3. Candidate models + scores table
  4. Selected model rationale
  5. Risks and caveats
  6. Next iteration recommendations
- Set `progress.json` status to `"completed"`.
- Output: `step-16-report.md`

## Repair Protocol (When a Step Fails)

When a step script exits non-zero or a validation gate fails:

1. Read the **full traceback** — do not guess the cause.
2. Identify the root cause category:
   - **Shape/column mismatch** → check that the prior step's output JSON was read correctly and field names match.
   - **Empty array** → check filtering logic in the current step; print intermediate shapes before failing.
   - **Import error** → check available packages; substitute or skip optional dependency.
   - **Type error** → check dtype assumptions against the actual parquet schema.
3. Fix only the failing step's script. Do not touch other step files.
4. Re-run the fixed script and re-run the validation gate.
5. After 3 failed attempts, stop and report: step name, last traceback, root cause diagnosis, and what was attempted.

## Global Constraints

- Use **`polars`** for all data operations (no pandas).
- Use **`scikit-learn`** for all modeling. Add optional sklearn-compatible extras only if already installed.
- Set `random_state` on every stochastic operation.
- **Never write a monolithic pipeline script** — one `.py` file per step, period.
- Error handling must surface root causes — no bare `except` clauses that swallow exceptions silently.
- All generated Python code lives under `CODE_DIR`.
- The `orchestrator.py` invokes each step script as a subprocess and supports `--resume` (skips steps whose output JSON already exists).

---

## `PipelineContext` Data Contract

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Any

@dataclass
class PipelineContext:
    dataset_id: str
    target_column: str
    time_column: str | None
    features: list[str]
    split_strategy: dict[str, Any]
    model_candidates: list[dict[str, Any]]
    metrics: dict[str, float]
    artifacts: dict[str, str]   # step name → file path
    notes: list[str]            # warnings, decisions, caveats
```

Context is passed between scripts by serializing it under the `"context"` key of each step's output JSON. Each step script reads the prior step JSON, reconstructs the context, does its work, and writes an updated context into its own output JSON.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- All 7 step scripts exist under `CODE_DIR` and are individually executable from the CLI.
- Running any single step script in isolation (given prior step outputs) produces correct output without requiring a full pipeline re-run.
- `model.joblib` loads cleanly in a fresh Python process and `model.predict(X)` runs without error.
- `step-16-report.md` is human-readable and addresses all 6 sections.
- `progress.json` has `"status": "completed"` at the end.
- All step scripts are inventoried in `code_audit.json`.
- Every validation gate passes for every step.
